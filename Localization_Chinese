Translated: "Your store is now ready to open. To allow customers in press the green button located in the manager's room. But first read the important info below:  - Every Thursday market inflation increases on some products and you will have to review prices.  - You can drop empty boxes in the container just outside OR carry them to the farthest container across the street and earn some money back by recycling it. Money can be increased with a perk.  - At day 8, thieves and trash will have a chance to spawn. The solution to both is the broom: hit the thieves and they will drop their stolen products.  - Each checkout can have a queue of 8 customers, they won't become impatient but extra customers that do not detect a free checkout queue, will become thieves and leave without paying.  - You can check lights and other decoration by pressing X or Z by default while using the Builder.  - You can definitely clear a shelf row from its products by right clicking it with the pricing tool. Useful if you don't want any employees to keep restocking that row.  - Pay attention to the invoices tab in the manager's blackboard. Your employees wages and electrical or rent invoices will arrive there.  - To close the store wait until it's 22:30 PM and press the red button in the manager's room. Game is saved automatically every new day.  - The more players, the more difficulty. (Try hitting players with the broom)" → "您的商店现在可以开业了。为了让客户按下位于经理房间中的绿色按钮。但是首先阅读以下重要信息： - 某些产品的每个星期四市场通货膨胀率都会增加，您将不得不审查价格。   - 您可以将空箱子放在外面的容器中，也可以将它们带到马路对面最远的容器，并通过回收利用来赚钱。可以用福利增加金钱。   - 在第8天，盗贼和垃圾将有机会产卵。两者的解决方案是扫帚：击中小偷，他们会丢下被盗的产品。   - 每个结帐都可以有8个客户的队列，他们不会变得不耐烦，但是没有发现免费结帐队列的额外客户将成为小偷，而无需付款而离开。   - 您可以在使用构建器时默认按X或Z检查灯和其他装饰。   - 您绝对可以通过使用定价工具右键单击其产品中的架子行。如果您不希望任何员工继续进行该行，有用。   - 注意经理黑板中的“发票”选项卡。您的员工工资以及电气或租金发票将到达那里。   - 要关闭商店，请等到22:30 pm，然后按下经理房间中的红色按钮。每天都会自动保存游戏。   - 球员越多，困难就越多。 （尝试用扫帚击打球员）"
