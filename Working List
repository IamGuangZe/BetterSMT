- add a option to make the alarm system only work XX amount of time ~RpcSoundAlarm
- increase default amount of items in boxes ~boxNumberOfProducts
- change how many items thieves steal ~thiefProductsNumber
- add some negative effect to trash ~private void TrashManager()
- raising difficulty from 0-10 to 0-20?30?100? lol ~ GameData.Instance.difficulty

- starting the game with one employee
- increase thieves based off amount of self checkouts vs normal checkouts
- auto ordering new box for backroom when you have none
- change trashing boxes to cost money, recycling to give money? (idk someone suggested this one)
- scale down the object sizes of shelves/freezer/fridge/all items (to fit more in store?)

- modify restockPriority to where instead of it just prioritizing amount of items, instead of percent missing. currently runs off %%, so 20% of missing toothpaste and 20% of missing TP vastly different things
- cache any boxes on the ground or in a player/employee's hand, and the amount of items in the boxes, and respawn them at the start of a new day
